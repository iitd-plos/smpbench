Prepare:
-------
sudo apt-get install libtool mysql-server libmysqlclient15-dev gfortran mpi libevent-dev libevent1-dev automake libboost-all-dev libbz2-dev libatlas-base-dev libtiff-dev gcc-4.8 g++-4.8 gcc-4.8-multilib g++-4.8-multilib clang-3.6 gcc-powerpc-linux-gnu

Put your user password in the environment variable as follows (change the
password to something insecure before doing this, your password will be
visible in plaintext):

export SUDO_PASSWORD=<user-sudo-password>

Use the following password for mysql-server: "root"

mkdir ../tars
cd ../tars && wget http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/~sbansal/software/tars/* && cd -

Build:
-----
./configure
make crosstool

For CINT:
make cint

For others:
make build


Instructions for Vectorization (TSVC) benchmarks
------------------------------------------------

# Source code is present in "tsvc/prog1.c"

Compiler version:
-----------------
1. The compiler version being used is -- gcc-8, clang-6.0 and icc-18.0.3
2. You can configure the compiler path in Make.conf by modifying the path specified in "CLANG6_0", "GCC8" and "ICC".

Compile instructions:
--------------------
1. make tsvc
2. The binary files will be generated at path "../smpbench-build/tsvc/"

Instructions for running the benchmarks:
----------------------------------------
1. Copy the files in "tsvc/scripts/" folder in your home directory
2. Execute tsvc_experiment.sh to run the eqchecker for benchmark suite for all three compilers.
3. The default configuration is :
   -- Number of parallel cores to use -- 15
   -- Unroll factor for gcc, icc - 7
   -- Unroll factor for clang - 15
   -- lookahead - 6
   -- Timeout - 30k seconds
4. The run scripts assume that the "superopt", "llvm-build" and "smpbench-build" folders are present in home directory.
